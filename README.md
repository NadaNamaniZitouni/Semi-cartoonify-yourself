# Semi-cartoonify-yourself
This is a small project created for fun to provide a little information about Computer Vision and OpenCV library
To run this project, It is better to use an IDE that provides a display option

What is OpenCV?
Python is a rich ecosystem with a wide range of libraries available for various real-world applications. One prominent library in this ecosystem is OpenCV. OpenCV is a versatile, cross-platform library specifically designed for Computer Vision tasks. It offers functionality for tasks such as video and image capturing, as well as image processing. OpenCV is widely utilized for tasks such as image transformation, object detection, face recognition, and many other impressive applications in the field of Computer Vision.
